# Triangle
#### This is an App which tracks Triangles 

#### By: Elidenis Njenga

## Description
This tracker will help in identifying whether a triangle is an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.

-An equilateral triangle must have all it's sides equal.
-An isosceles triangle has two of its sides exactly equal.
-As for an scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
NB: If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle cannot be formed using those values.

| Behaviour our program should handle           | Input   | Output     |
| ----------------------------------------------|---------| -----------|
| Enter three digits/numbers                    | 2,2,4   | 2,2,4      |
| Check if the numbers can                      | 9,4,3   | False      |
  form a triangle               
| If sum of two sides is > than the 3rd         | 2,3,4   | True       |
| If all 3 sides are equal                      | 2, 2, 2 | Equilateral|
| If 2 sides are equal                          | 2, 2, 1 | Isosceles  |
| If none of the sides are equal                | 4, 6, 5 | Scalene    |
